/**
 * Provider abstraction — the adapter contract between a host (Electron main)
 * and any AI-agent backend (Claude Agent SDK, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, …).
 *
 * ## Design goals
 * 1. The renderer and IPC layer only see `RuntimeEvent` — they never know which
 *    provider produced it. `AgentProvider.startTurn` takes a prompt + cwd and
 *    yields `RuntimeEvent`s via `ProviderContext.emit`.
 * 2. Capability negotiation: the host reads `AgentProvider.capabilities` to
 *    decide what UI/flow to present (e.g. show an approval bar vs. not).
 * 3. Inversion of control: provider *calls back* into the host for user decisions
 *    (`requestApproval`, `requestUserInput`). The host (RuntimeManager) bridges
 *    those async callbacks to the renderer via IPC, so the provider never touches
 *    Electron directly — it's testable without Electron.
 * 4. Adding a new provider should need only (a) implement `AgentProvider`,
 *    (b) `registry.register()` one line, (c) expose it in `provider.list`.
 *    No changes to RuntimeManager, IPC RpcMap, frontend store, or persistence.
