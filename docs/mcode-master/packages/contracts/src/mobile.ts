/**
 * Mobile companion contracts — pairing, devices, and the RPC-over-HTTP shape.
 *
 * The mobile app is a web page served by the desktop's main process over LAN.
 * It pairs via a QR-code + 6-digit verification code, then calls a whitelisted
 * subset of the same operations the renderer uses (but transported over HTTP
 * + SSE instead of Electron IPC). This file defines the wire types shared by
 * the main-process server and the mobile bundle.
 *
 * The pairing protocol is intentionally transport-agnostic: the types below
 * describe a "direct LAN" handshake today, but nothing here assumes a socket
 * — a future relay/TURN transport can reuse the same request/response shape.
