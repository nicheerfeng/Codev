/**
 * Emits a `.gz` and a `.br` copy of every text asset right next to the
 * original in the build output. The mobile HTTP server
 * (`src/main/mobile/serveMobileStatic.ts`) picks these up via
 * `Accept-Encoding` and serves them with Content-Encoding — zero runtime CPU
 * cost, and the phone's cold start over a VPS/relay link drops from ~5.5MB to
 * ~1.3MB. HTML is intentionally skipped: it's tiny and must stay uncached.
 *
 * Compression runs in `closeBundle` against the FINAL files on disk (after
 * Vite's HTML plugin has rewritten the entry chunks and written everything),
 * NOT against `output.code` from `generateBundle`: the in-memory snapshot is a
 * transient intermediate where Vite has already substituted dynamic-import
 * deps with a `__VITE_PRELOAD__` marker that only becomes defined once the
 * rewritten HTML is emitted — compressing that snapshot produces broken
 * `.gz/.br` files (ReferenceError: __VITE_PRELOAD__ is not defined on the
 * phone, while the desktop file:// load works fine). Compressing the written
 * files guarantees the served bytes are identical to what the desktop loads.
