/**
 * Rebuild native modules for a specific target architecture.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * The old `rebuild:native` script was a flat shell command:
 *   `electron-builder install-app-deps && node build/fix-node-pty-conpty.cjs`
 * `electron-builder install-app-deps` rebuilds for process.arch (the runner's
 * native arch) only. That was fine when CI built a single arch, but now macOS
 * builds split into arm64 and x64 jobs, each on a matching runner. The x64
 * job (macos-15-intel) needs node-pty rebuilt for x64; the arm64 job
 * (macos-latest) for arm64. On a matching runner install-app-deps already
 * targets the right arch, but we also need fix-node-pty-conpty.cjs to pick
 * the right conpty/<arch> binaries - it reads `npm_config_arch`.
 *
 * This script:
 *   1. Reads MCODE_ARCH (set by CI). When unset (local dev), rebuilds for the
 *      host arch - same behavior as before.
 *   2. Sets `npm_config_arch` so downstream tooling (fix-node-pty-conpty.cjs)
 *      resolves the matching arch-specific binaries.
 *   3. Runs electron-builder's JS CLI entry (`electron-builder install-app-deps`,
 *      plus `--arch` when MCODE_ARCH is set) with the current Node binary,
 *      inheriting stdio so CI logs stream through. We spawn the JS entry
 *      directly instead of the `electron-builder` bin shim because on Windows
 *      the shim is a `.cmd` file, which child_process.spawnSync refuses to run
 *      without `shell: true` (CVE-2024-27980 -> EINVAL for .cmd/.bat files).
 *   4. Runs fix-node-pty-conpty.cjs (no-op on non-Windows).
 *
 * Run via `pnpm --filter @mcode/desktop rebuild:native`.
