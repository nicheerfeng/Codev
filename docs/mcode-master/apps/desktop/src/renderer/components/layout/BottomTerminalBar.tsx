/**
 * Bottom-bar terminal host.
 *
 * Replaces the terminal that used to be a tab in the right panel — the fixed
 * 360px sidebar was too narrow for a usable terminal, so it moved to a wider
 * bottom bar scoped to the center pane's width.
 *
 * This component is always mounted (the parent keep-alives it by collapsing
 * its height to 0 instead of unmounting). `active` flows down to TerminalPanel
 * → TerminalView, which uses it to decide whether to fit/focus: when the bar
 * is collapsed the PTYs and scrollback stay alive but fit calls are skipped
 * (TerminalView guards on `active` and swallows fit errors from a zero-size
 * host); when it expands again, the `active` flip re-fits and focuses.
