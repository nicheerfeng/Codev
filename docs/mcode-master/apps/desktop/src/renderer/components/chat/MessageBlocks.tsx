 *  - Paste attachments (attachmentKind="paste" or undefined): clipboard icon,
 *    one-line preview. CLICKING opens a floating `TagPopover` anchored to the
 *    chip — exactly the same UX as the composer's ContentTagChip. No
 *    "拆开" (expand-into-editor) action: once sent, the text belongs to the
 *    user's message, not to the composer, so there's no editor to inline into.
 *  - File attachments (attachmentKind="file"): file icon + name; CLICKING opens
 *    the file in the center IDE editor (markdown renders, images preview, text
 *    edits — the editor picks the view from the extension). The full path lives
 *    in the hover title. Legacy file cards without a path fall back to the
 *    paste-style popover.
 *
 *  The popover uses `position: fixed` (viewport coordinates), so scrolling the
 *  message stream does NOT move it — the popover stays put while the chip
 *  scrolls out from under it. This matches the composer behavior and avoids
 *  the fragility of an inline expand inside the (potentially virtualized)
 *  message list. The popover is dismissed on outside-click / ESC / re-click
