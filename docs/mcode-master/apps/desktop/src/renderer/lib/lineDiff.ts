/**
 * Line-level diff using the LCS (longest common subsequence) table.
 *
 * Why LCS and not Myers: file-level Edit snippets from Claude are small
 * (typically < 200 lines) so the O(n*m) memory cost is trivial. LCS is
 * ~40 lines, dead-obvious to audit, and gives the standard "diff" output
 * users expect from a code-review tool: kept lines, removed lines
 * (red), added lines (green).
 *
 * Output: a flat list of `{op, text}` in old-then-new order, suitable
 * for rendering as a single column. `equal` lines have no prefix; the
 * caller decides the visual prefix (+/-/space).
