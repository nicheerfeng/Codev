/**
 * Flat message catalogs, merged per locale. The zh catalog is the source of
 * truth: `MessageId` is derived from its keys, and the en catalog is typed as
 * `Record<MessageId, string>` so a missing/en-extra key fails typecheck.
 *
 * Keys are flat dotted ids namespaced per area file (`common.*`, `layout.*`,
 * `chat.*`, `ide.*`, `browser.*`, `settings.*`, `store.*`, …). Keep new keys in
 * the area file that owns the components using them — the split exists so
 * parallel migrations never touch the same file.
