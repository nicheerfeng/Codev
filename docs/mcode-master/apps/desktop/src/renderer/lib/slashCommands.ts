/**
 * Composer skill-command data layer.
 *
 * The `/` menu lists skills discovered from the local filesystem (user-global
 * `~/.claude/skills/` + active-project `.claude/skills/`). The store fetches
 * the list over IPC and caches it; this module provides the type the cache
 * holds and the filter used by the picker.
 *
 * Selecting a skill creates an atomic skill tag (a chip above the textarea,
 * replacing the `/query` trigger token); the user then types their message and
 * sends the turn. The `/name` invocation is injected into the prompt by
 * composePromptWithTags on Send. The SDK is started with `skills: "all"`, so
 * the agent recognizes and runs the skill.
 *
 * This is intentionally separate from the Cmd/Ctrl+K app command palette
 * (`lib/commands.ts`) and from terminal custom commands.

 *    context). Disabled while a turn is running.
 *  - `init`: fills the editor with an editable AGENTS.md-generation prompt so
 *    the user can tweak it before sending.
 *  - `browser`: fills the editor with a browser-control prompt template so the
 *    user can fill in a URL + intent (snapshot / click / screenshot / device),
 *    then send. Surfaces the agent browser feature to users who otherwise
 *    wouldn't know it exists.
 *  - `sidechat`: opens the right-panel quick-ask tab (pure navigation — no
 *    prompt is inserted; the composer is left empty). Available even while a
 *    turn is running, which is the feature's core scenario: ask about the
 *    streaming output without interrupting it. */
