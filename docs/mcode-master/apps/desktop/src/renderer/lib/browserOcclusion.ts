/**
 * Geometry registry deciding whether open renderer-DOM popups actually
 * overlap the embedded browser's WebContentsView rect.
 *
 * The browser view is an OS-level surface that always floats ABOVE the
 * renderer DOM — no CSS z-index can stack a portaled popup on top of it. A
 * popup that reaches into the browser's on-screen rect therefore forces the
 * view to hide (BrowserPanel parks it offscreen). But popups elsewhere —
 * composer dropdowns in the center pane, etc. — don't: hiding the view
 * anyway blanked the whole browser panel (its white stage showing through)
 * every time any dropdown opened anywhere.
 *
 * BrowserPanel publishes its stage rect (setBrowserStageRect) on every bounds
 * sync; each `useSuppressBrowserView(open, popupRef)` callsite registers its
 * popup's measured rect while open. `shouldSuppressBrowserView()` is the
 * decision: hide only when some open popup overlaps the stage — unknown
 * geometry (no measurable popup or no active stage) suppresses
 * conservatively, matching the old always-hide behavior.

 *  React portals mount their node one render AFTER `open` flips (base-ui's
 *  FloatingPortal creates the container div via setState in a layout effect),
 *  so a popup ref is still null when the hook's effect registers geometry.
 *  That state must NOT mean "suppress everywhere" — it hid the view for 1-2
 *  frames on EVERY popup open (hide → rAF remeasure → show = the "browser
 *  flashes when a select opens" bug). An occluder holding this rect is
 *  treated as never overlapping: the popup is still invisible in its
 *  opacity-0 entry transition at that point, and the hook's rAF remeasure
 *  replaces the sentinel with the real rect within a frame — the view hides
 *  (if truly overlapped) before the popup becomes visible. Distinct from
 *  `null`, which stays reserved for ref-less callers (full-window dialogs)
