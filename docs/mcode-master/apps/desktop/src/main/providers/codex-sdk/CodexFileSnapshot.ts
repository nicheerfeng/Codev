/**
 * Codex per-turn file snapshot — extends FileSnapshot with unified-diff
 * reconstruction for auto-approved edits.
 *
 * The app-server only surfaces file changes AFTER they land, as a cumulative
 * per-turn unified diff (`turn/diff/updated`). That diff is the ONLY capture
 * path on this provider: unlike Claude/Pi there is no pre-write hook, and the
 * approval request params carry only `grantRoot` (no per-file paths), so the
 * approval handler cannot recordPre either — freeze() reconstructs each
 * changed path's pre-turn content by reverse-applying the diff to the current
 * on-disk content. Reconstruction is conservative — any hunk mismatch drops
 * the rewind entry (the card stays honest).
 *
 * Deleted files (present pre-turn, removed in-turn) reconstruct via the
 * diff's whole-file deletion section and restore as `modified` entries
 * (writing the original content back).
