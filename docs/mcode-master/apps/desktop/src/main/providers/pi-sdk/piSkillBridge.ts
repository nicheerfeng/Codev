/**
 * Skill bridge: make Mcode's skill directories and `/name` trigger syntax work
 * with the Pi SDK.
 *
 * Pi's skill mechanism is structurally different from Claude's, and the project
 * was originally wired only for Claude, so skills silently no-op under the Pi
 * provider. Three mismatches had to be fixed together (any one alone leaves the
 * feature broken):
 *
 *   1. **Path mismatch.** Pi's `DefaultResourceLoader` scans `<agentDir>/skills`
 *      (`~/.pi/agent/skills`) and `<cwd>/.pi/skills` (`CONFIG_DIR_NAME=".pi"`),
 *      but Mcode stores user skills in `~/.mcode/skills` and project skills in
 *      `<cwd>/.claude/skills` (see `ipc/skills.ts:resolveSkillRoot`). Pi scans
 *      none of them, so `getSkills()` returns an empty set.
 *
 *   2. **Trigger syntax mismatch.** Pi only recognizes `/skill:name`
 *      (`agent-session.js:_expandSkillCommand` gates on
 *      `text.startsWith("/skill:")`). The composer serializes a skill pill as a
 *      bare `/name` (`ComposerEditor.tsx` `renderText`), so Pi falls through to
 *      `expandPromptTemplate` and ships the literal `/name` to the LLM.
 *
 *   3. **`req.skills` dropped.** Unlike Claude's `Options.skills` allowlist, Pi
 *      has no skill option on `createAgentSession`; the only hook is
 *      `resourceLoader`, and `skillsOverride` is the name-based filter.
 *
 * The bridge:
 *   - {@link buildPiSkillLoader} constructs a `DefaultResourceLoader` whose
 *     `additionalSkillPaths` pulls in the two Mcode roots (Pi's own defaults are
 *     kept so existing `~/.pi` users aren't disrupted), and whose
 *     `skillsOverride` narrows the discovered set to the user-selected names
 *     when `req.skills` is non-empty.
 *   - {@link rewriteSkillPrefix} rewrites a leading `/name` to `/skill:name` for
 *     the names the loader actually resolved, so Pi's `_expandSkillCommand`
 *     recognizes the invocation.
 *
 * This module is provider-internal: the renderer/contracts/IPC layers are
 * provider-neutral and don't change (skill pills render off the `skillNames`
 * persisted on the message text block at send time, independent of the
 * provider).

 * `/skill:` at `text[0]` (`agent-session.js:951`), so rewriting mid-text would
 * have no effect on Pi and would only corrupt the user's message. A skill pill
 * embedded mid-sentence isn't expanded by Pi regardless; for those, Pi's
 * `formatSkillsForPrompt` already lists every discovered skill in the system
 * prompt and the model can load it via the `read` tool as a fallback.
 *
 * `knownNames` is the set of names the (allowlist-filtered) loader resolved —
 * the same set Pi's internal `find(s => s.name === skillName)` will search, so
 * the rewrite never produces a `/skill:` token Pi can't expand (which would
 * otherwise fall through to the LLM as a literal).
 *
 * The character class is deliberately wider than Pi's `^[a-z0-9-]+$` name
 * validation: Mcode skills may carry uppercase/underscores, and validation
 * failure only produces a *warning* (the skill still loads with its original
 * name), so we must match the raw name. The trailing negative lookahead
 * `(?![A-Za-z0-9_-])` stops the match at the token boundary so `/pdf-docs more`
