/**
 * Build the SDK subprocess `env` for a custom endpoint, from an ApiConfig.
 *
 * The SDK's `Options.env` REPLACES the subprocess environment entirely (per
 * sdk.d.ts), so we always spread `process.env` first — otherwise PATH/HOME
 * disappear and the claude binary can't even boot.
 *
 * Shared between:
 *   - {@link ClaudeAgentSdkProvider} (live turns)
 *   - {@link ../../ipc/customModel.ts} `probeEndpoint` (connection test)
 * so the two paths stay byte-identical.
 *
 * ## How the model id reaches the API

 * The claude binary consults TWO channels and they MUST agree:
 *
 *   1. `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` (subprocess env) — the binary's native model override.
 *      Recognized in the bundled binary's env-var allowlist (verified against
 *      v0.3.218 / claude code 2.1.218). This is the channel DeepSeek's official
 *      Claude Code integration guide configures, and the channel the binary
 *      uses to route the primary turn.
 *   2. `Options.model` (→ `--model` CLI flag) — also read by the binary; an
 *      explicit `--model` generally takes precedence over the env var.
 *
 * For a custom config we deliberately drive the model through `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`
 * ONLY and leave `Options.model` unset. Passing both, with the env var carrying
 * a `[1m]` suffix and `Options.model` carrying a bare name (or vice-versa), was
 * a previous bug that produced "selected model may not exist". Letting the
 * binary resolve from a single source (the env var) matches DeepSeek's
 * documented working config and avoids the dual-channel disagreement.
 *
 * ## Background tiers — mirror the selected model everywhere
 *
 * The binary also issues BACKGROUND requests under its internal tier system
 * (sub-agent Task tool, haiku-class side calls), each routed via a dedicated
 * env var:
 *
 *   ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL / _SONNET_ / _OPUS_ / _FABLE_
 *   CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL   (not a model alias — Task-tool context)
 *   ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL   (legacy haiku alias read by older builds)
 *
 * The config's model list is FLAT — there are no per-tier models anymore — so
 * every tier var is set to the SELECTED model's bare id. Without this, the
 * tiers fall back to Anthropic's built-in model names, which only exist on
 * Anthropic's own endpoint: on a third-party gateway the Task tool dies with
 * "no available channel for model claude-…-…" 503s before doing anything.
 * Tier vars NEVER carry the `[1m]` suffix — background requests are
 * short-context, and a suffixed id on a tier the gateway doesn't expect was
 * the historical "haiku channel receiving deepseek-v4-pro[1m] it doesn't
 * serve" mismatch.
 *
 * ## 1M context — the `[1m]` suffix (LOWERCASE)
 *
 * Declared via a `[1m]` suffix on the model name (e.g. `deepseek-v4-pro[1m]`),
 * NOT via the SDK's `betas` option. This is the convention used by DeepSeek's
 * `/anthropic` endpoint and most third-party gateways — they do NOT recognize
 * Anthropic's native `anthropic-beta: context-1m-2025-08-07` header.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: the suffix is LOWERCASE `[1m]`, matching DeepSeek's official
 * documentation (https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/agent_integrations/claude_code/):
 *   ANTHROPIC_MODEL=deepseek-v4-pro[1m]
 * The binary internally normalizes any casing to lowercase anyway (its init
 * handshake logs `model=deepseek-v4-pro[1m]` regardless of input casing), so
 * emitting lowercase up front keeps the diagnostic log honest.
 *
 * The suffix is carried ONLY on `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` (the primary turn's model)
 * — when the selected model's entry declares `supports1m`. Background tier
 * vars use the bare name; see above.
 *
 * ## Request headers — `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS`
 *
 * The endpoint's `customHeaders` (plus an auto session id for gateways that
 * require one) ride `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS`, one `Name: Value` per line.
 * This mirrors {@link ../../bridge/bridgeServer.ts} for the `openai` protocol,
 * where the bridge merges the same set into its upstream request instead —
 * the two paths must stay in sync, which is why the shared policy lives in
 * {@link ../../upstreamHeaders.ts}.
