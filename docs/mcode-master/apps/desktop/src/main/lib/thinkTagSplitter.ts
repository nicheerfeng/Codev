/**
 * Streaming splitter for `<think>...</think>` reasoning tags.
 *
 * Reasoning models served over OpenAI-compatible endpoints (DeepSeek R1,
 * QwQ, …) often inline their chain-of-thought inside `delta.content`,
 * wrapped in `<think>`/`</think>`, instead of (or in addition to) the
 * dedicated `reasoning`/`reasoning_content` field. Forwarded verbatim, the
 * raw tags land in the chat as literal text. This scanner re-splits the
 * stream so enclosed content is routed to a thinking block while
 * everything else stays text.
 *
 * Shared by both consumers of OpenAI-protocol surfaces: the claude-side
 * bridge (providers/bridge/responseTranslator.ts, Anthropic SSE re-emission)
 * and the codex app-server adapter (item/agentMessage/delta → the main
 * thread's text/thinking channels). Pure module — no imports.
 *
 * ## Streaming safety
 *
 * A tag can straddle chunk boundaries (`<th` + `ink>`), so a per-chunk
 * indexOf would miss it. The scanner therefore holds back any trailing
 * bytes that could still grow into the active tag — i.e. a proper prefix
 * of `<think>`/`</think>`, at most 7 chars — until the next chunk
 * disambiguates. An ordinary `<` in prose or code flushes as soon as the
 * next byte breaks the prefix match, so latency impact is one chunk at
 * worst, and only for chunks ending exactly on a tag prefix.
