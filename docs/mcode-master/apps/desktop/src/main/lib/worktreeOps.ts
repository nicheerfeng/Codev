/**
 * Git worktree lifecycle for isolated agent sessions.
 *
 * Two worktree FORMS (sessions record the intent in sessions.wt_style; the
 * form is chosen in the composer's environment picker and consumed exactly
 * once, at materialization):
 *
 *  - "detached" (the original, default) — a DETACHED checkout for
 *    experimental verification: no branch, agent edits stay uncommitted,
 *    merge-back auto-commits and merges by SHA, nothing survives removal.
 *    Detached because git forbids the same branch in two worktrees, and a
 *    branch name is a user-level decision this flow deliberately defers.
 *
 *  - "branch" — checked out on a GENERATED `mcode/<dirname>` ref (directory
 *    and branch share the name) for real feature work: commits inside are
 *    named and durable, visible in `git log --all`, and recoverable after a
 *    forced removal via the retained branch (remove only ever uses
 *    `git branch -d`, which refuses unmerged refs by design).
 *
 * Both share the identical single-direction flow: work in isolation (the
 * per-turn cwd drives every path guard), then merge the worktree's HEAD back
 * into the local checkout (SHA-based — the form is transparent to merging)
 * and remove the worktree.
 *
 * Managed root: <userData>/worktrees/<repo>/<branch>-<n> — OUTSIDE every
 * registered project root, so the project-scoped IPC guards never see these
 * paths and no "second legal root" plumbing is needed for the MVP.
 *
 * Safety rails kept from the full design: dirty worktrees are never silently
 * destroyed (remove refuses unless force; merge-back auto-commits first), a
 * running turn blocks removal, and remove can export the uncommitted diff as
 * a patch before deleting (last-resort recovery).
