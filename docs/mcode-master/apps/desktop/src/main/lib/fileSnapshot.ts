/**
 * Per-turn file snapshot — backs the "撤销本轮" feature (Claude Code's
 * `/rewind` analog, scoped to a single turn).
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *   1. `recordPre(cwd, filePath)` is called once for each file Edit/Write
 *      touches in the turn. The first call snapshots; subsequent calls
 *      for the same path are no-ops (the *original* content is what
 *      matters, not the latest).
 *   2. At turn end, `freeze()` returns the list of files for the renderer
 *      and marks the snapshot as "ready to rewind", then RELEASES the
 *      in-memory file contents: the rewind path restores from the frozen
 *      entries (rendered card / persisted turn_files), never from this map,
 *      so keeping the texts would only pin an idle session's last-turn
 *      files in memory forever.
 *   3. What survives freeze are the PATHS (`hasPaths`) — the runtime uses
 *      them to decide whether a rewind targeted the live snapshot before
 *      calling `clear()`.
 *
 * Path safety: every path is `path.resolve(cwd, filePath)`-d before any
 * disk access and rejected if it escapes `cwd`. This prevents a hostile
 * prompt from getting us to write outside the project working directory.
 *
 * Why we don't use git / a real checkpoint: out of scope for v1. The
 * roadmap reserves checkpoint timeline for P5; this is the lightweight
 * "last turn only" version that solves 90% of the actual user pain
 * (accidental file overwrite / wrong edits) without taking on a
 * dependency.
