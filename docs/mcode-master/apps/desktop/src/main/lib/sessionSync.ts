/**
 * sessionSync — broadcast session-list mutations to every connected client.
 *
 * `RuntimeManager.emit` fans out events from INSIDE a turn only. Session-row
 * mutations (create / title / delete / archive / pin / rename) happen in the
 * desktop IPC handlers and the mobile RPC handlers — outside any turn — so
 * without this helper one client's list would go stale the moment the other
 * client mutates a row (mobile-created sessions never appearing on the
 * desktop until restart, and vice versa).
 *
 * The two transport channels mirror `RuntimeManager.emit` exactly:
 *  - `sendToRenderer(IPC.CLAUDE_EVENT, …)` → desktop renderer's `ingestEvent`
 *    (same channel the per-turn stream already uses; no new IPC surface).
 *  - `mobileEventBus.broadcast(e)` → every paired phone over SSE.
 *
 * Only SLIM rows are broadcast (see `SessionListEntry` in contracts/runtime):
 * the heavy per-session payloads (`turnFiles.before` can hold whole file
 * contents) must not ride a list-sync event.
